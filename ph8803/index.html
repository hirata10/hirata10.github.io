<H1 align="center">Physics 8803 -- Cosmology</H1>

<HR>

<P>This course is an introduction to cosmology. This is aimed mainly at 1st and 2nd year graduate students interested in CCAPP, but students from all 
research specialties are welcome.
 
<P>I will assume as background the standard advanced undergraduate courses (E&M, quantum, statistical mechanics). I will <B>not</B> assume prior knowledge of 
general relativity or observational astronomy (I will introduce some concepts from these areas as needed).
 
<P>The course will meet Wednesdays and Fridays, 9:35-10:55 AM, in Caldwell 119. The first class will be held on Wednesday, January 9.

<P>Topics covered will include the following. We may explore some topics in more or less depth depending on student interest.
<UL>
<LI>The expanding Universe; redshifts, distance measurements, cosmic acceleration, etc.
<LI>Thermal history of the Universe: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, recombination, the cosmic microwave background.
<LI>Linear perturbations in cosmology: inflationary models of the origin of perturbations, CMB anisotropies, large scale distribution of matter
<LI>Non-linear structure: formation and history of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the intergalactic medium
<LI>Observational aspects of cosmology surveys

<P>On the first day of class, we will choose the homework due date and the office hour times.

<P>Grading in the course will consist of homework sets (75%) and a final paper/presentation (25%). There will be no final exam, but we may use the exam 
slot for additional presentations. Logistical information on your final paper/presentation will be distributed when we come back from spring break.
