<H3>About our group (and about being a student/postdoc in cosmology)</H3>

<P><B><I>How often do you have regular meetings? What should I come to?</I></B>

<P>Every week, we have joint group meetings with David Weinberg's group (in astronomy), which is used for general updates and discussions with visitors. There 
is also a weekly cosmology paper discussion (with participants from other parts of CCAPP), which is sometimes more general but also can get into technical 
details if they are important for working in large-scale structure. We also have a weekly WFIRST-focused meeting.

<P>Group members should come to a reasonable fraction of these meetings and the Tuesday CCAPP seminars -- they are an essential part of the training 
experience, but this needs to be balanced against the investment of time (coming to everything can add up). Interested first-year students may come to a few 
events to learn about what life is like in our group. More advanced students and postdocs will make an assessment of which events are most useful, and may 
increase or decrease their participation depending on other responsibilities (e.g., project or job applications). It is important for your intellectual 
development and breadth to attend each of the group events at least occasionally.

<P><B><I>Can (or should) I collaborate with other professors during my time at OSU?</I></B>

<P>Absolutely yes -- for at least two reasons:
<OL>
<LI>Working with another professor or group is an excellent way to experience another mode of doing research and learn something that I may not know or be 
able to teach you. You will have responsibilities in my group (so please make sure to communicate with me to avoid over-commitments), but your main reason 
for being at a university should be to learn and grow. This will also help you to develop research directions that are not continuations of my program.
<LI>When you apply for your next position, you will need letters of recommendation. If you apply for a postdoc in academia, 3 is standard, and when you get 
to the faculty level there will be more. That means you want at least 2 additional letters (either from OSU, or someone else in a collaboration, or both) 
that can attest to what it is like working with you. This is good practice anyway -- we are all aware that there is a power dynamic between faculty (no 
matter how well-meaning) and students/postdocs, and you want to have checks and balances.
</OL>

<P><B><I>What if I want to do pure theory and am not interested in data and statistics?</I></B>
