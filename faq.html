<B>How often do you have regular meetings? What should I come to?</B>

Every week, we have joint group meetings with David Weinberg's group (in astronomy), which is used for general updates and discussions with visitors. There 
is also a weekly cosmology paper discussion (with participants from other parts of CCAPP), which is sometimes more general but also can get into technical 
details if they are important for working in large-scale structure. We also have a weekly WFIRST-focused meeting.

Group members should come to a reasonable fraction of these meetings and the Tuesday CCAPP seminars -- they are an essential part of the training experience, 
but this needs to be balanced against the investment of time (coming to everything can add up). Interested first-year students may come to a few events to 
learn about what life is like in our group. More advanced students and postdocs will make an assessment of which events are most useful, and may increase or 
decrease their participation depending on other responsibilities (e.g., project or job applications). I do believe it is important for your intellectual 
development and breadth to attend each of the group events at least occasionally.
