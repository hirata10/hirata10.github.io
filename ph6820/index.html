<H1 align="center">Physics 6820 -- General Relativity</H1>

<HR>

<P>This course is an introduction to general relativity, aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Standard undergraduate coursework (including mechanics, special relativity, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra) will be assumed as background. I will <B>not</B> assume you have had any prior exposure to tensor calculus or curved manifolds; the first part of the course will introduce this material.
 
<P>The course will meet Wednesdays and Fridays, 12:40-2:45 PM, in Smith Lab 1094. The first class will be held on Wednesday, August 21.

<P>The main course text will be Bernard Schutz, <I>A First Course in General Relativity</I>.

<P>Topics covered will include the following: (note I changed the ordering to follow the book)
<UL>
<LI>Overview; perspectives on GR
<LI>Special relativity
<LI>Coordinate systems, vectors, up and down indices, tensors
<LI>Stress-energy tensor
<LI>Tensors, geodesics, and calculus on curved manifolds
<LI>The postulates of general relativity and Einstein's equations
<LI>Weak field gravity -- gravitational redshift and the deflection of light
<LI>Gravitational waves
<LI>Compact stars, black holes, gravitational collapse, and the event horizon
<LI>The expanding Universe -- the Friedmann equations and dark energy
