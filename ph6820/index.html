<H1 align="center">Physics 6820 -- General Relativity</H1>

<HR>

<P>This course is an introduction to general relativity, aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Standard undergraduate coursework (including mechanics, special relativity, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra) will be assumed as background. I will <B>not</B> assume you have had any prior exposure to tensor calculus or curved manifolds; the first part of the course will introduce this material.
 
<P>The course will meet Wednesdays and Fridays, 12:40-2:45 PM, in Smith Lab 1094. The first class will be held on Wednesday, August 21.

<P>The main course 

<P>Topics covered will include the following:
<UL>
<LI>Historical overview
<LI>Coordinate systems, vectors, up and down indices
<LI>Tensors, geodesics, and calculus on curved manifolds
<LI>Special relativity in the language of tensors
