<H1 align="center">Physics 6820 -- General Relativity</H1>

<HR>

<P>This course is an introduction to general relativity, aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Standard undergraduate coursework (including mechanics, special relativity, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra) will be assumed as background. I will <B>not</B> assume you have had any prior exposure to tensor calculus or curved manifolds; the first part of the course will introduce this material.
 
<P>The course will meet Wednesdays and Fridays, 12:40-2:45 PM, in Smith Lab 1094. The first class will be held on Wednesday, August 21.

<P>The main course text will be Bernard Schutz, <I>A First Course in General Relativity</I>.

<P>Topics covered will include the following: (note I changed the ordering to follow the book)
<UL>
<LI>Overview; perspectives on GR
<LI>Special relativity
<LI>Coordinate systems, vectors, up and down indices, tensors
<LI>Stress-energy tensor
<LI>Tensors, geodesics, and calculus on curved manifolds
<LI>The postulates of general relativity and Einstein's equations
<LI>Weak field gravity -- gravitational redshift and the deflection of light
<LI>Gravitational waves
<LI>Compact stars, black holes, gravitational collapse, and the event horizon
<LI>The expanding Universe -- the Friedmann equations and dark energy
</UL>

<LI>Class will be shortened on Wednesday, September 25 (end at 1:50 PM). CCAPP postdoc Ami Choi will teach the Friday, September 27 class at the usual time.

<H3>Procedures</H3>

<P>Homeworks will be due on Fridays. Office hours will be held on Thursdays, 11-12 and 4-5, in PRB M2010 (starting Aug. 30).

<P>There will be an in-class midterms (1 hour) and a final exam. Please contact the professor if you require alternate arrangements for either or both exams.
<UL>
<LI>The mid-term exam will be on <B>Wednesday, October 9</B> from 12:40-1:40 PM in Smith Lab 1094.
<UL>
<LI>The mid-term will be <B>open notes</B> (including your notes from the course, and my lecture notes).
<LI>The exam duration will be <B>1 hour</B>.
<LI>There will be <B>1 problem</B> on the midterm. You will get a metric and be asked to do some standard calculations with it. The problem will not require any specialized prior knowledge -- the methods we have covered in class will suffice.
</UL>
<LI>The final exam will be on <B>Monday, December 9</B> from 4:00-5:45 PM in Smith Lab 1094.
</UL>
<P>Grading will be based on the homework (75%), midterm (10%), and final (15%).
